-- Topic Ranking of Documents
- each document can have MULTIPLE relevant topics

- given: stream of documents
		 a predefined set of topics: Y ; |Y| = k 
		 each has 0 or more topics associated with it

- Reuters 2000, k = 103
  Reuters 21578, k = 91

- there are semantic overlaps b/w topics
Hence, one doc is associated with >1 topic

- a doc is labeled with a set 'y' of relevant topics; y is a subset of Y

- Reuters 2000, avg y = 3.2
  Reuters 21578, avg y = 1.24

- a topic/class/category 'r' is `relevant` for a given doc, if r belongs to y.

- Topic ranking algorithms return a list of topics ranked a/c to their relevance.

- Feedback for each doc is set 'y'
	-- also set of relevant topics y

- Topic ranking v/s Feedback:
Topic ranking algo outputs total ordering of the topics
Feedback is a coarse partial ordering into two sets


----------------

- Representation
- Document x_bar: 
	using vector space model as a vector in R^n

	so a doc is denoted by its vector representation x_bar belongs to R^n.

- Prototypes w1_bar, w2_bar.. Wk_bar
	each prototype is denoted by its vector representation wr_bar belongs to R^n.	

- vector space representation is based on Pivoted Length Normalization.

- algos in this paper construct prototype vectors from examples.
--> from a corpus S containing T docs, each of which is associated with a set of relevant topics, 
S = {(x^-t, y^t) | 1<= t<= T,
					x^-t belongs to R^n,
					y^t is a subset of Y}.

- this S induces a ranking on topics a/c to their similarity to vector rep of doc

--> inner products of prototype wi_bar and x_bar induce an ordering a/c to relevance level of each topic.

--> if wr_bar.x_bar > ws_bar.x_bar => topic r is ranked higher than s

- Perfect Ranking
--> for any pair of topics r and s, st r belongs to y but s does not belong to y, relevance score induced by r is more than that induced by s.

- Quality of Perfect Topic Ranking:
--> margin: size of gap b/w the lowest score among relevant topics to the highest score among non relevant topics
